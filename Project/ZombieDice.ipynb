    "Read the rules of the game carefully. On paper or a whiteboard, determine what classes and subclasses you need to create this game. What values and bahaviors belong to these classes? Think about the game step by step, what is happening and what information is needed? Try to forget about specific lines of code for this part and maybe even spend MOST of your time here planning. Draw [class diagrams](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2019.html) for classes and flow charts for each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements to account for in your strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need a `Dice` class, a `ZombieDiceGame` class, and a `Player` class with appropriate attribute values and functions, along with `Dice` subclasses to represent the green, yellow, and red dice that come with the game. \n",
    "- Dice subclasses should have emoji faces, rather than dots and keep track of whether the roll result is a brain, blast, or footprints. Because dice still have 6 sides, and dictionaries require unique keys, it may be useful to keep the value of the roll attribute numerical.\n",
    "- At least 2 `Player` subclasses, one representing a different strategy than your default (e.g., greedy or random) and the other to implement an `InteractiveMode` where user input determines whether to roll again or not\n",
    "- All rules and features of the game should be implemented correctly, including but not limited to allowing for 2 or more players, using 13 dice, finishing the round even after a player has won, etc.\n",
    "- If you are working with a partner, you must also implement one of the [Zombie Dice expansions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Dice#Expansions): *Zombie Dice 2: Double Feature* with 3 additional special dice, or *Zombie Dice 3: School Bus* with a 12-sided dice and some more intricate player decision making."

    "\n",
    "Your `ZombieDiceGame` class should facilitate players taking turns and determine when a player wins. Instanciating a new game should at least require `Player` objects, _who_ will play the game. `ZombieDiceGame` must accept a variable number of players. For example...\n",

    "\n",
    "All of your class definitions should demonstrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- separation of concerns, \n",
    "- proper use of naming conventions, \n",
    "- proper use of class and object attributes, \n",
    "- proper use of arguments including `self`, \n",
    "- well-named functions and variables and/or clear, concise documentation (i.e., your code should be easy to read), \n",
    "- appropriate use of loops and data structures as needed (e.g., lists, dictionaries, tuples)\n",
    "\n",
    "And when you instanciate objects and call the methods of those objects (Part 3) your code should run without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional, fun:** Change the theme. Instead of *zombies* chasing *humans* collecting *brains*, your game can be based on any chase-and-collect scenario. Must be non-violent if game characters are based on real people."
