    "For this exercise, visit [PetFinder's list of cat breeds](https://www.petfinder.com/cat-breeds/), and model 3 breeds of your choice as Python classes. Each cat breed class should en-*tail* at least 3 attributes, and 2 methods. The attributes and methods can be simple or complex or silly, as long as they have *some* relation to the descriptions of that breed on PetFinder. The methods can be the same as long as the implementation is specific to that breed. Think about what the cats _do_ (what _methods_ the classes will have) and how that \"behavior\" may affect or be affected by their attribute values."
